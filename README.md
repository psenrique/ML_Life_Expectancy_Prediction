# AAI-510_Life_Expectancy_Prediction
Life insurance is a way to insure someone's life and in the event of a terminal illness or death. The life insurance policy would pay out to the loved ones of the person insured. The insurer has the job of determining the risk the person faces of death and to determine what sort of premium and terms to put in place for that specific policy. The project will thus be aimed at helping to determine key factors that would influence someone's life expectancy that can then be used to predict the risk and life span of future clients.

Our proposed approach is to use perform regression analysis to determine these key features from WHO life expectancy data.
